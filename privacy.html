        example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google
        search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies
        to
        serve ads based on someone's past visits. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own
        privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.<br>

        You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want
        to
        you can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently using a browser plugin.
